  <h1>Algebra Module</h1>
  <p>Here you will learn the key concepts of algebra, step-by-step examples, and practice problems.</p>

  
  <h2>1. What is Algebra?</h2>
  <p>Algebra is the study of numbers, symbols, and the rules for manipulating them.
    Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that generalizes arithmetic by using symbols,
    or variables (like 'x' or 'y'), to represent unknown quantities and relationships between them. 
    It involves manipulating these symbols with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) 
    and other rules to form and solve equations, describe patterns, and model real-world situations, serving as a bridge to more complex mathematical concepts.   
     For example, the expression <span>\(2x + 3\)</span> means “two times x plus three.”</p>

  
  <div class="example">
    <h3>Example: Solve an Equation</h3>
    <p>Solve the equation: <span>\(2x + 3 = 7\)</span></p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
    <p>\(2x + 3 = 7 \implies 2x = 4 \implies x = 2\)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="exercise">
    <h3>Practice Problem</h3>
    <p>Solve the equation: <span>\(3x - 5 = 10\)</span></p>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer('ans1')">Show Answer</button>
    <div id="ans1" class="answer">
      Solution: \(3x - 5 = 10 \implies 3x = 15 \implies x = 5\)
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Quadratic Equations</h2>
  <p>The standard form is: <span>\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\)</span>, where \(a \neq 0\).</p>

  <div class="example">
    <h3>Example: Solve a Quadratic Equation</h3>
    <p>Solve: <span>\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\)</span></p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
    <p>\((x-2)(x-3)=0 \implies x=2 \text{ or } x=3\)</p>
  </div>
